# FlyAway
An online marketplace app I developed just for the fun of it.

## What is it?
FlyAway is kind of like Letgo. It acts as a marketplace where people can look for or buy items that people list online. Products can be cosmetic products, electronics, apparel, and more. When a user finds something they are looking for, they can contact the seller within the app (still in development). Likewise, a user can list their own items that they don't want or need anymore. Transactions would be made in person.

## What is used

### Pods used
1. [Firebase](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Firebase)

### Other

##### There are others installed, but not used as of yet. This list may or may not be updated as time goes on.

## How do I use it?
If the app doesnt seem to work, try the following:
Make sure to enter a new and unique bundle identifier and assign your own team (profile) to the app in its general settings.

Other than that, you should be good to go! Feel free to sign up an account and play around with it. 

## More to come
Some features are not yet developed, and I plan on incorporating them in the future.
In fact, here are a few features I plan on adding to the app:
1. Pull-to-refresh - to update the listings dashboard
2. Filtering dashboard listings
3. Search section - it is empty as of now. Feel free to check the design link below to see how it should end up.
4. Messaging - between sellers and potential buyers
5. Location - map showing general location somewhere in listing

Feel free to try to do some of these on your own! Have fun.
